1 . How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

   The way I ensured my code was functional and secure was by using Junit to test specific requirements. Another way I made sure my program was functional and secure was by trial and error until everything was up to standard.
   
  
  
  
 2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
  
  
  In this project, we had a rubric that asked us to implement certain requirements and test said requirements using Junit to ensure that it works. The way I interpreted these user needs and incorporated them was by following the rubric extremely carefully and making sure my program was perfect before submission.
  
 
 
 
 
 
 3. How do I approach designing software?
  
  
  
  What you put in is what you get out. I approach designing software with that philosophy in mind and take my time to learn it the right way not the fast way. I took my time with this project and it paid off in the end.
